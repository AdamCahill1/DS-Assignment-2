### Phase 1.

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer - Fully implemented and working.
+ Rejection Mailer - Fully implemented and working.
+ Log Image -  Fully implemented and working. 
+ Queue and DLQ -  Fully implemented and working. 

### Phase 2 (if relevant).

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer - Fully implemented and working.
+ Rejection Mailer - Fully implemented and working. 
+ Log Image - Fully implemented and working. 
+ Update Table/Image Metadata -  Fully implemented and working. 
+ Filters -  Fully implemented and working. 

### Phase 3 (if relevant).

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer(Triggered when Item is added to the database) - Fully implemented and working. May send email when an object is deleted from the database. (Missing if statement in the confirmation mailer/ mailer.ts to check for eventName)
+ Process Image - Fully implemented and working. 
+ Log Image - Fully implemented and working. 
+ Update Table/Image Metadata -  Fully implemented and working. 
+ Delete Image - Fully implemented and working. 
+ Filters -  Fully implemented and working.
